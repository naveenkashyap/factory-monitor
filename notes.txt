# Step 1
# stop using Status_Attributes
# stop sending all statuses
# collect more than just status. Collect everything 


# Step 2
# Unkown -> idleOther
# Pending -> pending
^^DONE^^
# Waiting -> Idle - Pending (Calc on Grafana -- need to upgrade Grafana and influxDB. Current version cannot handle this)

# Step 3
# FactoryCompletedStats
# trace how schedd_status is created (call stack -- explore ctags for vim)
# Go into github to find how the rrds are being created (Log_Completed_Stats Log_Completed_WasteTime Log_Completed)
# this might be similar to how schedd_status.xml is created in parallel with status_attributes.rrd is created

# Step 4
# Duplicate to rabbitMQ
